Western to Indian Classical Music notation translation.

Currently it is a simple dictionary based translator that takes in Western notes CDEFGABC, and converts it into the ICM sargam, given the key for Sa.

Goals:
1. Currently does not differentiate between octaves. This needs to be added.
2. Also add in OMR functionality to automatically read and transcribe western sheet music to sargam.
3. Add ability to do the reverse, i.e. given a key for Sa and a sargam, to convert it into western notation, and subsequently print it as sheet music.
